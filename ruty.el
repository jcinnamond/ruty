;; The automated typing code.
;;
;; The input to the type function should be the structured list
;; returned by the parser (below). The way each element is typed
;; depends on its type. Characters are simply inserted, but structured
;; syntactic elements (such as classes) are automatically closed by
;; inserting the corresponding 'end' immediately. This avoids
;; situations where a series of 'end's are typed at the end, and it
;; keeps the structure of the code clearer as it is typed.
(defun ruty/type (content)
  (unless (null content)
    (ruty/insert-element (car content)) ;; insert the current element
    (ruty/type (cdr content))))         ;; insert the rest of the elements

;; This is the function that understands the kind of content to
;; insert. It supports four types of content. Pairs are balanced
;; structures, typically expected to occur on the same line (e.g.,
;; parenthises). Multiline pairs are balanced structures expected to
;; span multiple lines. Newlines are treated specially because we want
;; to rely on the mode's indentation, rather than typing each space
;; character. Anything else is just inserted verbatim.
(defun ruty/insert-element (element)
  (let ((type (car element))
	(content-body (cdr element)))
    (case type
      ('pair           (apply 'ruty/insert-pair content-body))
      ('multiline-pair (apply 'ruty/insert-multiline-pair content-body))
      ('newline        (ruty/insert-newline))
      (t               (ruty/insert type)))))

;; Insert balanced content by typing both the opening and closing
;; characters simultaneously, moving the point back to between the
;; balanced pair, typing the content, and then moving to beyond the
;; closing character once done.
(defun ruty/insert-pair (start end content)
  (ruty/insert start)
  (insert end)
  (goto-char (- (point) (length end)))
  (ruty/type content)
  (goto-char (+ (point) (length end))))

;; Insert balanced content over multiple lines. This works much like
;; insert-pair, above, except that it puts the closing keyword on its
;; own line and ensures it is indented properly.

  (ruty/pause))

;; Simulate a real typist by pausing for a random amount of time
;; between each charater. Most pauses will up to 0.13 seconds, but
;; occasionally the pause could be up to 0.25 seconds. This variation
;; makes the typing less uncanny.

;; The Ruby parser
;;
;; This is a crappy, hand rolled recursive descent parser for Ruby
;; that does just enough to pull out some important structures such as
;; classes, modules and methods. It returns a list of elements, where
;; each element is a single character to type or another list
;; containing some structured information. This list can be fed
;; directly to the automated typer.
;;
;; The parser never uses a lookahead which occasionally leads to convoluted
;; matching (and potential mismatches).

;; The parser returns any remaining (unparsed) string along with the
;; structured data, so the parse-str function returns only the
;; structured data. The remaining string will be blank at this point.
(defun ruty/parse-str (str) (car (ruty/parse str)))

;; is no input remaining (which will result in the token 'done being

;; function for that state. The state's function is responsible for
;; extracting the token and any content for that token. (E.g., the
;; class state is responsible for returning a 'class token, and for
;; extracting the contents of the class.)
